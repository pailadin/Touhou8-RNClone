While applying for a job two-ish years ago (as of this writing), they told me to "make something weird". This is what I came up with: an attempt to replicate [he first stage of Touhou 8](https://youtu.be/tLXvt-a6hXE) in React Native.

It's missing many features, most notably I just couldn't get collision to work and the player does not attack, but it was fun trying to make something resembling a bullet hell shooter using something very much not designed for this purpose.
